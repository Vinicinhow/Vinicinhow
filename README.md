# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! 
Wow, wait! A visitor?! Hi my friend! How are you? ðŸ˜… My name is Vinicio, but you can call me just by "Vini". I'm a brazilian Web & Mobile Developer (i love Data Science too!) always in constantly growth!

I'm also an Economy university student at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS, in PT-BR). I really love the simple things in life, singing, dancing, traveling, meeting new people, cultures and experiences, helping the people around me and sure, programming (Yeah, i know that doesn't so simple but is fabulous!)... Well, being happy! This is it! ðŸ˜€
