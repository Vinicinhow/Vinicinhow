# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! 
Hello! Welcome to my profile. It is my honor to have you here!
â€¢ My name's Vinicio (but you can call me just by "Vini").
â€¢ I'm 19 years old.
â€¢ I'm a college boy (student of Economy at Federal University of Sergipe).
â€¢ Brazilian, but i have an intermediate English level. (Relax, I can do you understand me haha)
â€¢ Passionate for Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and anything that can involve my two specialties: Economy & Python! :)

I am still a Junior Data Scientist. But I am constantly learning more and more to keep up to date about what is new in this "Data Universe". For me, there is nothing so difficult that it cannot be analyzed and understood. With calm, patience, and of course a lot of technique, I can extract extremely valuable information that can shed light on the causes of various social problems and even save businesses! This is why I study Data Science and decided to specialize in it. Helping is what I like and what I want! But how can i help you today, my friend? ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘Š
