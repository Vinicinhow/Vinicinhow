I'm also an Economics student at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS, in PT-BR). I really love the simple things in life, singing, dancing, traveling, meeting new people, cultures and experiences, helping the people around me and sure, programming (Yeah, i know that doesn't so simple but is fabulous!)... Well, being happy! This is it! ðŸ˜€
